# Pregnancy-Support-Initiative
In collaboration with the UCLA Center for Reproductive Science, Health, and Education I
designed and developed an interactive educational website to support students navigating early pregnancy, and for those intrested in the resources offered in the LA area for pregnancy. This was built using semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on accessibility and user-centered design.
